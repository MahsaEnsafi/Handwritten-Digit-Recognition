Features

- Data Handling: Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset by normalizing pixel values and reshaping images.
- Data Augmentation: Enhances the dataset with random zoom, flipping, and rotation.
- CNN Architecture: Constructs a convolutional neural network with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- Model Training: Compiles and trains the model using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
- Evaluation: Assesses performance on the test set and generates predictions along with a confusion matrix.
- Visualization: Plots training and validation loss and accuracy.
