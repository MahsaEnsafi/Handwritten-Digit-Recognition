This repository contains a simple deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on handwritten digits (0-9).
Features:
1. Uses the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
2. Neural network architecture with one hidden layer using ReLU activation.
3. Adam optimizer for efficient learning.
4. Confusion matrix visualization using Seaborn.
5. TensorBoard logging for monitoring training performance.
